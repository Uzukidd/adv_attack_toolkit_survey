- Desc: **Modular Adversarial Robustness Toolkit** makes it easy to compose novel attacks to evaluate adversarial robustness of deep learning models. Thanks to the modular design of the optimization-based attack framework, you can use off-the-shelf elements, such as optimizers and learning rate schedulers, from PyTorch to compose powerful attacks. The unified framework also supports advanced features, such as early stopping, to improve attack efficiency.
